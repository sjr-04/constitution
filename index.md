### The Constitution of the United States of America is fixed. The Constitution "says what it says, and doesn't say what it doesn't say." - Antonin Scalia

> [I]n all free states the constitution is fixed, and as the supreme legislative derives its power and authority from the constitution, it cannot overleap the bounds of it without destroying its own foundation

\- Samuel Adams, [*Massachusetts Circular Letter* (1768)](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/historic-document-library/detail/samuel-adams-and-james-otis-massachusetts-circular-letter-february-11-1768)

> [The King] has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation;
> 
> [...]
>
> For ... establishing therein an Arbitrary government

\- [*The unanimous Declaration of the united States of America* (1776)](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)

> The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.
> 
> [...]
> 
> Until the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act.
> 
> [...]
>
> That **inflexible** and **uniform adherence** to the rights of the Constitution, and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission. Periodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to their necessary independence. [emphasis added]

\- Alexander Hamilton, [*The Federalist* No. 78 (1788)](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed78.asp)

> The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But the Constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government. 
> 
> [...]
> 
> If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.

\- George Washington, [*The Address of Gen. Washington to the People of America on His Declining the Presidency of the United States* (1796)](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp)

> The first and governing maxim in the interpretation of a statute is to discover the meaning of those who made it.

\- James Wilson, *Of the Study of Law in the United States* (1791)

> The constitution, on which our Union rests, shall be administered by me according to the safe and honest meaning contemplated by the plain understanding of the people of the United states at the time of it’s adoption

\- Thomas Jefferson, [*To Providence Citizens* (1801)](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-33-02-0410)

> [O]n every question of construction, carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one in which it was past.

\- Thomas Jefferson, in a [letter to his Supreme Court nominee and Justice William Johnson (1823)](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-3562)

> ... I entirely concur in the propriety of resorting to the sense in which the Constitution was accepted and ratified by the nation. In that sense alone it is the legitimate Constitution. And if that be not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for a consistent and stable, more than for a faithful exercise of its powers. If the meaning of the text be sought in the changeable meaning of the words composing it, it is evident that the shape and attributes of the Government must partake of the changes to which the words and phrases of all living languages are constantly subject. What a metamorphosis would be produced in the code of law if all its ancient phraseology were to be taken in its modern sense.

\- James Madison, [*To Henry Lee* (1824)](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/04-03-02-0333)

As you can see, the Founding Fathers themselves were what we today called "originalists." They believed in interpreting texts as they were understood when first adopted. Many anti-originalists love citing Thomas Jefferson as a proponent of the "living Constitution," the Darwinian theory that started under Woodrow Wilson, and has since been the dogma of progressives ever since.

Thomas Jefferson once said that the Earth belonged to the living.

> It may be proved that no society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation. ... The constitution and the laws of their predecessors extinguished then in their natural course with those who gave them being. ... Every constitution then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right.—It may be said that the succeeding generation exercising in fact the power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law had been expressly limited to 19 years only. ... But the power of repeal is not an equivalent. It might be indeed if every form of government were so perfectly contrived that the will of the majority could always be obtained fairly and without impediment. But this is true of no form. The people cannot assemble themselves. [source](https://jeffersonpapers.princeton.edu/selected-documents/thomas-jefferson-james-madison)

But do you know *why* Thomas Jefferson suggested that we should rewrite the Constitution every 19 years? Precisely because, if we don't, then the Constitution *still means whatever it meant when it was first adopted!* Thomas Jefferson was absolutely an originalist, and the previous quotes from him and the other Founding Fathers prove that. His suggestion was *not* to get, in our case, nine (or rather, a majority of five) unelected judges to read new meanings into old words. In some cases, it takes only one unelected judge. For a good amount of time during the Roberts Court (the current Court), former Justice Anthony Kennedy was the single most powerful man in the Nation. He was the swing vote. But his retirement in 2018 allowed for the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to replace him, securing the originalist majority on the bench.

The Founding Fathers agreed that the people, through their elected representatives, should update the Constitution if it lacks something. Unelected judges can not be trusted with this responsibility. The people and their elected representatives know better than they do. It is more democratic this way.
